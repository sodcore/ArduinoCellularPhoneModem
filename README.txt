Arduino library for running NimbleLink(SkyWire) Modem's
----------------------------------------------

All code is posted in the git-hub respositories

 This project is the begging of funtions to run the modem, so that they are simple to use.
 The hope of this project to expand the capabilities of the modem over time with addition of functions as 
 people see a need for them.

 To begin using this library begin by connecting the ardiuno Mega with the 
Nimble Link SkyWire Shield. www.niblelink.com and then plugging in the modem.
 The example is designed on a Arduino Mega board so we can use pins 18 and 19 for Serial 1 to be connected to 
 the pins that are normally connected to the Serial pins. (Place jumper cables between the serial pins of the 
 shield with serial pins 18 and 19 on the mega for Serial1)
 
 
  For use of the modem you can view my tuturial on You-Tube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acXN_uDP5ow
